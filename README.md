# LuaDo is an Android REPL application just for my own usekeyses

But if you want try it just build it from source as usual Android application

It is even not in beta and i have an idea to add libyaml and sqlite to operate as in SQLite command prompt (```.tables``` and so on)

Should repeate that this repo is only for my own usecases!

## Btw LuaDo looks not too bad for pre-alfa
